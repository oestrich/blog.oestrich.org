Welcome to my development blog. I am following Avdi Grimm's suggestion for a young developer, found [here](http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/08/19/letter-to-a-young-developer/), and creating a place online to reflect on the things I learn.

A bit about me, I am a developer for SmartLogic Solutions. I am mainly a Ruby on Rails developer, however I am interested in mobile development. I have been developing with Rails since November 2010. I have been programming in general since about 9th grade starting with TI-Basic. My first real language was PHP, moving on to python next.

This will be a blog filled with my experiences using ruby, rails, vim, javascript, linux, and anything else I come across. I hope you find some use out of it.
